# Binary and Linear Search

##Assignment

Write a program that 
a.	Generates 5000 random numbers and puts them in an array.
b.	Sorts the numbers using any sorting technique (Selection sort is fine, but you can try another one).  
c.	Ask the user for a number between 0 and 20,000 and search for it in your sorted array using a simple linear search. Is this a good idea?
d.	Ask the user for a number between 0 and 20,000 and search for it in your sorted array using a binary search.

Hint: To generate random numbers you need to include this module:
import random
To get a random number w :  

w = random.randint(0,20000) 
This will give w a random value between 0 and 20,000
